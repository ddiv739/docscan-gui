    PySimpleGUI self-learning exercise for combination with OpenCV and UI updates.
    A perspective mapping tool used to visualise how inverse perspective mapping takes place through a realtime output corresponding to input movement.
    Could also be used as a quick 'CamScan' type tool as required - output images are returned at full resolution unliked scaled UI output however it has
    not been tested robustly so better off as a demo application.

    Heavily inspired and based off the DragRect Demo - this example program showcases the simplicity of extension and overall awesomeness of PySimpleGUI

    Perspective Mapping inspired from PyImageSearch
