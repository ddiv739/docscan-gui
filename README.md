# docscangui with PySimpleGUI and OpenCV

PySimpleGUI self-learning exercise for combination with OpenCV and UI updates.

Requires OpenCV-Python, Pillow, PySimpleGUI, Numpy

A perspective mapping tool used to visualise how inverse perspective mapping takes place through a realtime output corresponding to input movement.
Could also be used as a quick 'CamScan' type tool as required - output images are returned at full resolution unlike the scaled UI output however it has
not been tested robustly so better off as a demo application.
